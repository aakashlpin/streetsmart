# Cheapass.in [`streetsmart`]

## What's Cheapass?

Cheapass tracked prices for products on Indian e-commerce companies, and sent notifications through email and push notifications.

Launched in Jun 2014 after a small weekend hack, this project grew over several years to serve over 7600 users across India.

The website was shutdown on 30th September 2017 after 40 months of operations.
