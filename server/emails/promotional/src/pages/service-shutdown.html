      <h1>Cheapass is shutting down.</h1>
      <p>It brings me a mixture of sadness and relief to announce that Cheapass will shutdown on <strong>1st Oct 2017</strong>.</p><br />
      <p>While this may come as a huge surprise to a lot of you given how well the service has been running for the last 40 months,
      the fact remains that Cheapass has been a one man operation and I've simply been way too busy with life and other work
      to give it the attention it deserves.</p><br />
      <p>Of late I'd been working on revamping the entire product to match the technology with scale, and while I was at it, I realized
      that Cheapass doesn't make enough revenue to support it as a full time endeavour, nor does it make enough to justify
      the burden (financial, administrative or otherwise) of supporting it out of hours. That said, Cheapass will remain
      the jewel in the crown of my professional work that was done without any intentions of making it large, so I'm still
      exploring the possibility of one day either open sourcing it or finding a person or company that would be interested
      in keeping it running. If you happen to know such a person, please tell them about this. To avoid setting any unrealistic
      expectations this means that the website, the bookmarklet, the Android app, and the iOS app will no longer be active,
      maintained or supported beyond 1st Oct 2017. In fact the disruption in service has already started and you might not be able to set any more alerts or receive any further price drop alerts.</p><br />
      <p>After Cheapass made its mark in this tech space, several such services have spun up and it should be easy migrating your
      existing alerts onto other such platforms.
      </p><br />
      <p>
         The support, admiration, attention and love this project has received from each one of you has been overwhelming. If you have
        any questions, concerns, or anything to say in general, please feel free to email me directly at <a href="mailto:me@aakashgoel.com">me@aakashgoel.com</a>.
      </p><br />
      <p>
Again, thanks for all the support over the last 3 years. It's been an honour and fun helping each of you save money while shopping
online.

      </p><br />
      <p>Cheers,<br />Aakash Goel</p>
