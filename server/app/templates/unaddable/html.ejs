Hi,

<br><br>

The URL <%= productURL %> could not be processed as a valid product page.

<br><br>

Here's what could have happened -
<br><br>
- You tried Cheapass on a page which is <u>not</u> a product page. Make sure it's a valid product page.
<br>
- The product might be sold out, out of stock or unavailable.
<br>
- The page might not have easily identifiable price information on the page.
<% if (seller === 'amazon') { %>
<br>
- Few product pages on Amazon.in cannot be added to Cheapass due to reasons beyond our control.
<% } %>

<br><br>

If you'd like some further help in this regard, hit reply.

<br><br>

Cheers,
