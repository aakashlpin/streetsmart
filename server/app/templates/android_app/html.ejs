Hello there!

<br><br>

I launched the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cheapass/id1052526562">iOS app</a> back in November, 2015. Since then, I've received hundreds of requests for "...waiting for the android version!".

<br><br>

The wait is over! **drum rolls**

<br><br>

I’m incredibly happy to launch the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.cheapass.droid">Cheapass Android App</a> today!

<br><br>

Here’s why you must install it (believe me you’ll love it):

<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>It sends you <strong>Real Time Push Notifications</strong> 📲 for every price drop ⏬ on every product ⌚️👗📹🌂📺🔦👝👓👞👖 you’ve been tracking via Cheapass ☃</li>
  <li>Add new alerts from other apps like Flipkart, Myntra, Snapdeal, Amazon etc.</li>
  <li>You no longer have to open an email 📬 to check the price drop</li>
  <li>It saves you money 💰</li>
  <li>(A lot of money 💰💰💰💰)</li>
  <li>Helps you buy when the price is affordable for YOU 🙋</li>
  <li>Super convenient to use 🍼</li>
  <li>It’s gorgeous in design 💖</li>
  <li>Tracks 10s of e-commerce websites for FREE! 🙌</li>
  <li>Getting notified of price drops was never THIS easy 👯</li>
</ul>
